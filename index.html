      <p class="summary">
        I am a Computer Information Systems major at UofSC Honors College and a DoD Cyber Service Academy Scholar, passionate about healthcare technology, cybersecurity, and IT infrastructure. My goal is to advance medical health IT by securing and optimizing healthcare systems.

        With hands-on experience in network operations, IT support, and cybersecurity research, I have worked as a Network Operator troubleshooting enterprise infrastructure and enforcing security policies. As an IT Service Technician, I resolved 300+ support tickets, ensuring system reliability. I also teach cybersecurity and develop multifactor authentication solutions through research.
        
        I am eager to connect with professionals in cybersecurity, IT infrastructure, and healthcare technology to drive innovation in the field.      </p>
