      <h1>Madeleine McBride</h1>
      <p class="summary">
        I am a third-year undergraduate Honors College student pursuing a B.S. in Public Health with minors in Psychology and Business Administration. I am passionate about improving health outcomes and addressing health disparities by implementing evidence-based solutions and advocating for health equity. I aim to promote equity through upstream solutions and policies that support historically marginalized populations.
